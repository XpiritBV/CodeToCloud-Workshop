## Overview

Fabrikam Medical Conferences (FabMedical) provides conference website services tailored to the medical community. They are refactoring their application code, based on node.js, so that it can run as a Docker application, and want to implement a solution that will help them get familiar with the development process, lifecycle of deployment, and critical aspects of the hosting environment. They will be deploying their applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and want to learn how to deploy containers in a dynamically load-balanced manner, discover containers, and scale them on demand.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture that needs to be implemented at Fabrikam Medical Conferences. 

The solution will use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which means that the container cluster topology is provisioned according to the number of requested nodes. The proposed containers deployed to the cluster are illustrated below with Cosmos DB as a managed service:

![A diagram showing the solution, using Azure Kubernetes Service with a Cosmos DB back end.](Assets/solution-topology.png)

Each tenant will have the following containers:

- **Conference Web site**: The SPA application that will use configuration settings to handle custom styles for the tenant.

- **Admin Web site**: The SPA application that conference owners use to manage conference configuration details, manage attendee registrations, manage campaigns, and communicate with attendees.

- **Registration service**: The API that handles all registration activities creating new conference registrations with the appropriate package selections and associated cost.

- **Email service**: The API that handles email notifications to conference attendees during registration, or when the conference owners choose to engage the attendees through their admin site.

- **Config service**: The API that handles conference configuration settings such as dates, locations, pricing tables, early-bird specials, countdowns, and related.

- **Content service**: The API that handles content for the conference such as speakers, sessions, workshops, and sponsors.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

   - To complete this lab, ensure your account has the following roles:

   - The [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)
     built-in role for the Azure Subscription you will use.

   - Is a [Member](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) user in the Azure AD tenant you will use. (Guest users will not have the necessary permissions).

   > **Note** If you do not meet these requirements, you may have to ask another member user with subscription owner rights to login to the portal and execute the create service principal step ahead of time.

   - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Before the Hands-on Lab. You will need eight cores if following the exact instructions in the lab, or more if you choose additional cluster nodes or larger VM sizes. If you execute the steps required before the lab, you will be able to see if you need to request more cores in your sub.

2. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

   - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.
   - [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
   - [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

3. You will install other tools throughout the exercises.
