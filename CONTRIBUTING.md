# Contributing to the Code To Cloud Workshop

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to our Code to Cloud Workshop!

There are many ways that you can contribute, beyond writing or coding. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or
contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Asking Questions

Have a question, issue or bug? Open an issue in the repository where you have the issue and add the issue to the `CodeToCloud Workshop Issues` project.

The active community will be eager to assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, and the project team is available via handful of different channels.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in a workshop? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue
The Code to Cloud project is distributed across multiple repositories. Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/XpiritBV/CodeToCloud-Workshop/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

New issues can be created using one of the following templates:
![](/Assets/IssueTemplate.png)

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - up vote
* 👎 - down vote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Please use the template for each issue.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/XpiritBV/projects/1) to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
