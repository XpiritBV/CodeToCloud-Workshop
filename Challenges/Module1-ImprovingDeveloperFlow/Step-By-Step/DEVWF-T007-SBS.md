## Step by Step DEVWF-T007

In this task, you will use YAML to define 3 GitHub Actions workflows that builds your Docker images and pushes it to a GitHub Container Registry automatically.

1. In your GitHub repository, and select the [Settings] tab.

2. From the left menu, select [Secrets].

3. Select the [New secret] button.

    ![Settings link, Secrets link, and New secret button are highlighted.](/assets/2020-08-24-21-45-42.png "GitHub Repository secrets")

4. In the [New secret] form, enter the name `CR_PAT` and for the value, paste in a GitHub Personal Access Token, with the following scopes.
    * repo
    * write:packages
    * read:packages

> You can use the same GitHub PAT that you created in the prerequisite setup and that is now stored in your local settings.json file in the .workshop directory in your GitHub CodeSpace
>
> To generate a new GitHub Personal Access Token, please follow the steps described [on this webpage](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

5. Navigate to the GitHub Actions in your repository and select [New Workflow]

6. Under the Continuous Integration Workflows, find the [Publish Docker Container] workflow and choose [Set up this workflow]

7. Rename the file to `fabrikam-web.yml`
8. Change the image name to fabrikam-web. This is the name of the container image that will be pushed to the GitHub Container Registry

```YAML
env:
  # TODO: Change variable to your image's name.
  IMAGE_NAME: fabrikam-web
```

9. Add a working directory to the [Build Image] and [Push image to GitHub Container Registry] step. This ensure the Docker file can be found

```YAML
      - name: Build image
        working-directory: content-web
        run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag $IMAGE_NAME

      - name: Push image to GitHub Container Registry
        working-directory: content-web
```
10. Remove the test job from YAML since we do not need it. Also remove the dependency in the push stage `needs: test`

```YAML
  # Run tests.
  # See also https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/automated-testing/
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          if [ -f docker-compose.test.yml ]; then
            docker-compose --file docker-compose.test.yml build
            docker-compose --file docker-compose.test.yml run sut
          else
            docker build . --file Dockerfile
          fi
```

11. Commit the file to the repository
12. The GitHub Action is now running and automatically builds and pushes the container

13. Next, setup the `content-api` workflow and the `content-init` workflow. Call the files `fabrikam-api.yml` and `fabrikam-init.yml` and change the container names also to `fabrikam-api` and `fabrikam-init`

14. Navigate to the packages in your GitHub account and see if the container images are present.
