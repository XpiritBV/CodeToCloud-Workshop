# Step by Step DEVWF-T006

In this task you are going to create a new Docker Compose file that contains the MongoDB, the API and the Web Application.

>This task has a Starter solution, that creates a Pull Request containing some files and instructions. 
>
> In order to run the automated Starter Solution, you need to go through the [Setup prerequisites]/Challenges/Prerequisites/RunThroughSetup.md) first!

1. In your GitHub Codespace, open a PowerShell Terminal and run the starter solution. A Pull Request with 2 Docker compose files will be created

    ```bash
    workshop-step  Start "DEVWF-T006"
    ```

2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the Tab Pull Requests and open the Pull Request with DEVWF-T006 in the title

3. In the Pull Request, check the conversation, Commits, Checks and Files Changed Tabs, and got through the instructions and changes.

4. On the Conversation Tab, press the Merge Pull Request Button, to merge the files in to the main branch. Link the Pull Request to your Azure Boards Work item for Module 1 by typing `AB#` followed by the workitem id for Module 1 (example: `AB#123`) in the title or description of the Pull Request Commit Message.

Now your repository contains 2 new "Docker Compose" files.

6. In your GitHub Codespace, update your files to the latest version by pulling them.

7. Open your PowerShell terminal window. From the root folder, start the application.

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f local.docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.init.yml build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f local.docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.init.yml up
    ```

8. To include the web application to the docker-compose file, add the following YAML snippet to the docker-compose.yml

    ```YAML
      web:
        image: fabrikam-web
        depends_on:
            - api
        environment:
            CONTENT_API_URL: http://api:3001
        ports:
            - "3000:80" 
    ```

   and the following YAML snippet to the local.docker-compose.yml

    ```YAML
    web:
        build: ./content-web
    ```

9. Build and run the docker-compose file again 

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f local.docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.init.yml build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f local.docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.init.yml up
    ```

10. Test the web application using the port forward method. In the Remote Explorer, forward port 3000 and open the browser by clicking the globe icon next to the port.
