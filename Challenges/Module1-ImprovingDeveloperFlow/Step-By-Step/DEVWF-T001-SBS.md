# Step by Step DEVWF-T001

In this task you are going to setup an integration between GitHub and Azure Boards, to be able to link work items and code commits.

There are 2 possible scenarios for this Step by Step

1. You have never used the Azure Boards integration before
2. You previously set up Azure Boards for another GitHub repository.

## You have never used the Azure Boards integration before

1. On the GitHub Marketplace, find the [Azure Boards Integration App](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards). 
2. On the bottom of the page, select Install it for free.

6. When the integration succeeded, you will be taken to the Azure Board. 4 Work items are present and you see a "Success" message

## You previously set up Azure Boards for another GitHub repository.

When you already used the Azure Boards integration, you need to manually link the GitHub repository and the Azure DevOps Project.

1. In your GitHub Repository, navigate to your profile and choose [Settings]. In the Settings page, navigate to the [Applications] tab and choose the [Configure] Button for the Azure Boards application.

4. When the integration succeeded, you will be taken to the Azure Board. 4 Work items are present and you see a "Success" message
