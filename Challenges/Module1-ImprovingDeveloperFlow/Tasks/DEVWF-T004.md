# DEVWF-T004 Optimize containers with a multi staged Docker File
Now that the complete application runs in Docker containers, development speeds is ramping up. Developers run multiple versions of the application side by side and they build new versions when needed. One of the developers notices that the size of the Docker images are quite large. After some investigation it seems that the images contain the complete SDK and supporting files to build the application. During runtime these files are not needed. Besides that, the container images contains many SDK files that contain security vulnerabilities. 

You and your team advice to start using multi staged Docker files. This way you can use containers to build the application and use a lighter version of the container to run the application. Besides that, you advice the team to start working with Pull Requests to share and review code, instead of the Gists that were shared earlier.

To help them out your team creates a Pull Request that contains the multi staged Docker file for the WEB, API and INIT applications.

## Before you start this challenge
This challenge needs some prerequisites. Run the following command in your Terminal windows of you GitHub Codespace to set this up.
```
.workshop/workshop-step.ps1  Start "DEVWF-T004"
```

## Challenge
In this challenge you will merge the Pull Request [Example for Multi-Staged Docker Files :whale: (DEVWF-T004)] to the main branch and link this to the Azure Boards Work Item [Module 1]. This PR contains 3 multi staged Docker file. Re-Build the WEB, API and INIT application and run the WEB and API container and check the differences. Also run `docker images` to see the difference in image size.

## Validation
* Pull Request has been created and merged
* Main branch contains multi staged Docker files
* Pull Request has been linked to Azure Boards Work Item (link with AB#WorkItemID)
* New Container for WEB, API and INIT built and run

> Tip
> Use the `docker ps -a` command to see which containers are running and stopped on your system
> Use the `docker rm` command to remove containers that have run earlier
> Link a Work item to a Pull Request or Commit by adding AB#<workitemid> to your title or description.
