# Instructions to Fix the exercise

Modified the deployment script to have the prefix as a parameter and added the GitHub Secret environment variable instead of a local variable. To run the deployment locally, add a environment variable first that contains the GitHub Personal Access Token to pull images from the GitHub Container Registry


```PowerShell
$env:CR_PAT="Your Pat Here"
./infrastructure/deploy-infrastructure.ps1
```
