# Storyline

Now that the Continuous Delivery pipeline has been set up, the product owner notices that changes, that she wants to announce all at once, are ending up straight into production. Even worse, some customers complain about these new features and unknown behavior. One of the developers mentions to start using feature flags to hide certain functionality. That is a great idea, but for now this is too much work and too complicated to set up. The team decides to set up a manual approval workflow to allow the product owner to approve changes before they end up in production.
