# Present the solution to the Fabrikam Medical Conferences Board

After some tough design sessions, you and your team are ready to present the solution to the board of Fabrikam. There are more companies invited to present their solution, so the board asks for a 15-minute chalk-talk format to keep them engaged throughout the day.

# Challenge

* Pair with another table (the board of Fabrikam)
* You present your proposed solution to the customer.
* The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.
* You responds to the objection.

Tables switch roles and repeat.

## Objection questions

* There are many ways to deploy Docker containers on Azure. How do those options compare and what are motivations for each?
* Is there an option in Azure that provides container orchestration platform features that are easy to manage and migrate to, that can also handle our scale and management workflow requirements?
