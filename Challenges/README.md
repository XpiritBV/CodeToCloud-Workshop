# CodeToCloud with GitHub and Azure DevOps Workshop

This repository contains the trainer materials for a workshop targeted at students in a instructor-led training. The workshop focuses on the Code to Cloud journey. The journey includes the integration with Azure Boards, working with GitHub Codespaces, the GitHub Flow, and the GitHub Container Registry. Students will learn to use docker and docker-compose and deploy their solution to an Azure Web App using GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps pipelines.

To make it challenging for the students, the workshop contains challenges that can also be done individually. To make sure students do not get stuck, there are scripts available with instructions to "automatically" fix a challenge, so students can continue. The workshop also contains extensive Step-By-Step videos and written instructions. There are also videos that explain the concepts that are used in the exercises.

This workshop focuses on the Code to Cloud journey. When you want to dive in to Cloud Native and the setup and configuration of Kubernetes, you can continue your learning journey with the [Cloud Native in a Day workshop of Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/Cloud-Native-In-a-Day), which builds upon the same sources.
