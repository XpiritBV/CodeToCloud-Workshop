# Scaling up the business
Susan is happy. Looking back at the goals she envisioned, things are progressing. The overall architecture has been dramatically improved, the development workflow is fast and efficient, and the quality increased because of the automation and review process. New tenants are easily added, because of the container setup and roll-out to the cluster. 

After a while, one of the customers of Fabrikam Medical makes an announcement that they developed a new vaccine and that they organize big conferences where they explain and promote this vaccine. When the first website goes live, things go wrong. Because of the heavy traffic the site goes down and stays down. Furthermore, updates that are pushed to production, take down the website for a few minutes. Last but not least, the customer want to run their conference websites on different domains. For every region where they organize a conference they want to run it within a subdomain.

You and your team saw this coming and advice Susan to move into some more advanced Kubernetes tech. You advice to start doing rolling updates, build a possibility to scale up and out and allow the customers to run subdomains.
