# Module 4 - Scaling up the business

Looking back at the goals Susan envisioned at the start of the cloud journey, things are looking great. The overall architecture has been dramatically improved, the development workflow is fast and efficient, and the quality increased because of the automation and review process. New tenants are easily added, because of the container setup and roll-out to the cluster. 

After a while, one of the customers of Fabrikam Medical made an announcement that they developed a new vaccine. They also announced that they started to organize big conferences where they explain and promote this vaccine. When the first website went live, things went wrong. Because of the heavy traffic the site went down and stayed down. Furthermore, updates that were pushed to production, took down the website for a few minutes. These issues need to be resolved. Last but not least, the customer wants to run their conference websites on different subdomains. For every region where they organize a conference they want to run it within a subdomain.

You and your team saw this coming and advice Susan to move into some more advanced Kubernetes tech. You advice to start doing rolling updates, build a possibility to scale up and out and allow the customers to run subdomains.

## Learning Objectives

In this modules you will learn to:
* Build High Availability in to your cluster and application
* Use Kubernetes Ingress Control to run multiple websites on the same cluster
* Scale out and scale up the cluster
* Deal with load and limited resources
* Do Zero-down deployments with rolling updates
* Create helm charts for your own application to facilitate easier deployment
