# Scaling up the application

One of the customers of Fabrikam has launched a new vaccine and is organizing conferences all over the world. Because of the publicity around this new vaccine the number of people visiting the Conference websites are sky rocketing. This leads to unexpected behavior, downtime and slowness of the application. 

After looking at the deployed application, you notice that the web application and API are running as a a single instance with a low allocation of memory. Time to get this under control.

## Challenge
In this challenge you will use the scaling possibilities of Kubernetes to scale out your API and WEB application. Furthermore you will use the Kubernetes deployment files to start an application with multiple pods. 

## Validation

* Scale up API to 5 pods
* Scale up WEB to 5 pods
* Change the API Kubernetes deployment file to create 3 pods after deployment and deploy this

> Tips
>
> * Visit the Web application URL (public IP) `/stats` and refresh to see the IP address of the API change
> * Change the replicaCount to change number of pods
