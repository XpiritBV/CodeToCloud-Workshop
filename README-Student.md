# CodeToCloud with GitHub and Azure DevOps Workshop - Student Materials

This repository contains the student materials for the Code To Cloud workshop. This workshop focuses on the Code to Cloud journey. The journey includes the integration with Azure Boards, working with GitHub Codespaces, the GitHub Flow, and the GitHub Container Registry. You will learn to use docker and docker-compose and deploy their solution to an Azure Web App using GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps pipelines.

To make it challenging, the workshop contains challenges that can also be done individually. To make sure you do not get stuck, there are scripts available with instructions to "automatically" fix a challenge, so you can continue your learning. The workshop also contains extensive Step-By-Step videos and written instructions. There are also videos that explain the concepts that are used in the exercises.

This workshop focuses on the Code to Cloud journey. When you want to dive in to Cloud Native and the setup and configuration of Kubernetes, you can continue your learning journey with the [Cloud Native Workshop Workshop of Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/Cloud-Native-In-a-Day), which build upon the same sources.
